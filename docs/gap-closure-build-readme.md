# HEADY™ Gap-Closure Build Package

**Generated:** 2026-03-16  
**Source:** Deep codebase scan of heady-production via authenticated GitHub API  
**Addresses:** All 8 critical gaps identified in the live scan

---

## Gap → File Map

### Gap #1: No Database Schema (neon-schema.sql was 404)
**File:** `db/migrations/001_foundation.sql`  
**What it does:** Complete Neon Postgres schema covering users, devices, sessions, OAuth connections (27 providers), onboarding state, memory T1/T2 with pgvector HNSW, distiller recipes (v8), pipeline traces, immutable audit log, wisdom entries, and bee registry. Includes φ-scaled helper functions for memory TTL extension, temperature migration, expired cleanup, and stale recipe archival. Seed data for 20 bee types and 6 learned rules.  
**How to apply:**
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://heady:YOUR_PASSWORD@ep-cold-snow-aesmiwt9.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
node db/migrate.mjs up
```

### Gap #2: Module System Mismatch (CJS ↔ ESM)
**File:** `auth/esm-bridge.cjs`  
**What it does:** Dynamic import() bridge allowing the 109KB CJS heady-manager.js to load new ESM modules without a full rewrite. Caches loaded modules. Provides a 4-phase migration strategy: (1) new code is .mjs, (2) migrate routes, (3) migrate manager, (4) remove bridge.  
**How to use from CJS:**
```javascript
const bridge = require('./lib/esm-bridge.cjs');
const { UnifiedAuth } = await bridge.load('auth/unified-auth.mjs');
```

### Gap #3: In-Memory Onboarding Store
**Addressed by:** `db/migrations/001_foundation.sql` (onboarding_state table)  
**What changed:** The `new Map()` with TODO comment in headyme-onboarding.js is replaced by a Postgres table with the same 8-step structure, step_data JSONB, 30-day TTL, and proper indexing.

### Gap #4: Dual Auth Systems Running in Parallel
**File:** `auth/unified-auth.mjs`  
**What it does:** Single entry point that bridges Firebase Auth (identity verification) with the 27-provider OAuth registry (profile/tokens) and new Postgres sessions (persistent state). Express middleware for session validation, tier-based authorization, and auto-renewal at the 13-hour mark. Replaces the dual Firebase + custom OAuth stack with one unified adapter.

### Gap #5: Only 2 CI/CD Workflows (vs 35+ claimed)
**Files:** `ci-cd/ci.yml`, `ci-cd/deploy-cloud-run.yml`, `ci-cd/deploy-edge.yml`  
**What they do:**
- `ci.yml`: Comprehensive CI pipeline — §7 Systematic Scan (localhost, build tools, console.*, PQC compliance), lint, type-check, security scan (pnpm audit + Semgrep + gitleaks), unit tests with coverage, integration tests with Postgres+Redis services, Docker build and push.
- `deploy-cloud-run.yml`: φ-stepped canary deployment (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%) with 60s health check at 5% and auto-rollback on failure.
- `deploy-edge.yml`: Cloudflare Workers deployment for edge proxy, AI gateway, and MCP telemetry workers with LR-001/LR-005 validation.

### Gap #6: All 11 Sites Are Stubs
**File:** `sites/headyme.com/index.html`  
**What it does:** Fully functional landing page with the φ-scaled dark premium glassmorphism design system. Sacred geometry canvas (fib(9)=34 nodes), hero with gradient text, 6 feature cards, stats bar, CTA section, and footer. Pure HTML + CSS + vanilla JS — zero frameworks, zero build steps (Law 3). WCAG AA accessible, responsive, prefers-reduced-motion respecting. Links to auth.headysystems.com for SSO.

### Gap #7: No SSO Config Across Domains
**File:** `auth/cross-domain-sso.mjs`  
**What it does:** Complete relay iframe + postMessage SSO implementation for all 11 Heady domains. Three server endpoints (relay HTML, status check, token exchange) plus a client-side script snippet for each site. One-time transfer tokens (5-minute TTL) prevent replay attacks. Origin whitelist enforced.

### Gap #8: No Formal Boot Orchestrator
**File:** `boot/boot-orchestrator.mjs`  
**What it does:** Dependency-aware service initializer mapping directly to the §8 Six-Layer Cognitive Architecture. Services register with layer (0-5), dependencies, init/healthCheck/shutdown functions, and critical flag. Layers boot sequentially; services within layers boot concurrently via topological sort. φ-scaled timeouts. Graceful shutdown in reverse order.

### Shared Infrastructure
**File:** `auth/logger.mjs` — Pino structured logger with 6 log types (system, error, activity, perf, security, distill) matching §34. Redacts sensitive fields. Pretty-print in dev, JSON in production.  
**File:** `db/migrate.mjs` — Database migration runner with checksum tracking, transaction safety, and Neon SSL support.

## Installation

Copy files to heady-production:

```bash
# From the heady-build directory:
cp db/migrations/001_foundation.sql    heady-production/db/migrations/
cp db/migrate.mjs                      heady-production/scripts/migrate.mjs
cp boot/boot-orchestrator.mjs          heady-production/src/boot/boot-orchestrator.mjs
cp auth/unified-auth.mjs               heady-production/src/auth/unified-auth.mjs
cp auth/cross-domain-sso.mjs           heady-production/src/auth/cross-domain-sso.mjs
cp auth/esm-bridge.cjs                 heady-production/src/lib/esm-bridge.cjs
cp auth/logger.mjs                     heady-production/src/lib/logger.mjs
cp ci-cd/ci.yml                        heady-production/.github/workflows/ci.yml
cp ci-cd/deploy-cloud-run.yml          heady-production/.github/workflows/deploy-cloud-run.yml
cp ci-cd/deploy-edge.yml               heady-production/.github/workflows/deploy-edge.yml
cp sites/headyme.com/index.html        heady-production/sites/headyme.com/index.html
```

Then run the migration:
```bash
cd heady-production
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
node scripts/migrate.mjs up
```

## What's Still Pending

These gaps are reduced but not fully closed — they need iterative work:

1. **Remaining 10 site scaffolds** — headysystems.com, headyconnection.org, headybuddy.com, headymcp.com, headyio.com, headybot.com, headyapi.com, headylens.com, headyai.com, headyfinance.com. Same design system, different accent colors and content.

2. **heady-manager.js ESM migration** — The 109KB CJS file needs incremental conversion. The esm-bridge.cjs provides the bridge for now.

3. **More CI/CD workflows** — Container scanning, DAST, performance baseline, DB migration CI, Drupal config sync, Android build improvements.

4. **Distiller implementation** — The schema tables exist. The service spec exists (in the v8 super prompt package). The actual src/distiller/ code files need to be built.

5. **Drupal 11 multisite setup** — The sites are currently static HTML. Full Drupal 11 installation with Config Split for per-site settings.
